Download: `Antares 0.4.0 for Mac OS X`_

Antares is based on Ares_, a game developed by `Nathan Lamont`_, and
released for the classic Mac OS in 1996. After a re-release by `Ambrosia
Software`_ and a major expansion which added support for plug-ins, the
game fell into obscurity, as it was not ported to Mac OS X. However, in
2008, the source code was released. Antares is a port of that code to
modern systems.

There are several issues that need to be fixed before the 1.0 release;
the issue tracker contains a `list of them`_. After they are fixed,
Antares will have feature parity with Ares in all respects, except for
plugins and multiplayer. These are considered features to be added after
1.0.
