Gamepad Controls
================

By default, the gamepad is in pilot mode.  In pilot mode, the left stick
controls the ship's facing, and A and B accelerate and decelerate,
respectively.  Holding down the left stick engages warp; clicking it
again disengages.  Primary and secondary weapons are linked to the right
trigger, and special weapons to the left.

Holding down the right bumper puts the ship in select mode.  In select
mode, pressing A, B, or X while pointing the left stick will select
objects.  Y will order your control object to go to your target object.
Clicking the left stick will transfer you to your control object.

Holding down the left bumper puts the ship in target mode.  In target
mode, pressing A, B, or X while pointing the left stick will target
objects.  Y will order your control object to go to your target object.
Clicking the left stick will engage autopilot.
